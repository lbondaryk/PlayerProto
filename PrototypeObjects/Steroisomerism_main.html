				<p>Consider but-2-ene for which the connectivity can be described as a CH3 group bonded to a CH, which in turn is doubly bonded to another CH, and then finally singly bonded to a CH3 group. Yet, due to the trigonal planar geometry about the alkenyl carbons, there are two possible ways to express this structure, both of which are shown. In one case, the two methyl groups are distal to each other, whereas in the second version they are proximal.</p>
				
				<p>The &pi; bond restricts rotation about the C2-C3 bond, preventing either of these from converting into the other. Despite their identical connectivity, they are not superposable structures and are, therefore, stereoisomers.</p>

				<p style="color:blue;">NOTE: At temperatures &ge; 450 &deg;C there is sufficient energy that the &pi; bond may be broken and these two stereoisomers can interconvert at a reasonable rate. At ambient temperatures, however, this process is not energetically feasible and these structures are stereochemically stable.</p>

				<p>Alkenes are stereogenic if switching two of the groups attached to the same alkenyl carbon results in a stereoisomer. Transposing a hydrogen and a methyl group attached to the same carbon in but-2-ene produces a structure that is not superposable on the original compound. Notice in the original structure that the two methyl groups are on opposite sides of the double bond with respect to the plane that is perpendicular to the page and passes through each carbon of the double bond. After the switch, the two methyl groups are proximal to each other. Simple translation of the modified structure onto the original shows that these two compounds are non-superposable.</p>

				<p>This process produces a pair of stereoisomers permitting us to define the alkenyl carbon as a stereocenter in this compound. If the same operation had been performed on the other alkenyl carbon, the same result would have been observed. Therefore, both carbons of a stereogenic alkene are stereocenters.</p>

				<p style="color:blue;">TIP: In evaluating whether or not the alkene is stereogenic, it is satisfactory to perform the substituent change on one of the alkenyl carbons.</p>

				<p>It is instructive to observe that switching the substituents on both stereocenters does not produce a new stereoisomer, but rather regenerates the original compound. This requires the resulting structure be rotated to superpose onto the original. If in comparing two structures it is discovered that they are identical they are referred to as <b>homomers</b> (Latin, homo-, same).</p>

				<p>A stereogenic alkene is capable of generating exactly two stereoisomers. As will be explored in detail later, the maximum number of stereoisomers that a molecule can generate is 2n, where n is the number of stereogenic units. It is for this reason that it is preferable to count it as a single stereogenic unit.</p>

				<p>Touch the two groups and observe how the two structures cannot be superposed on top of each other; apply this to all of the structures that appear in this section. Select the carbon that will have the two groups switched, and then they can then drag the new structure on top of the original structure to verify that they are not superposable. It would also be useful, especially for the upcoming discussion with tetrahedral carbons, if the student had the ability to rotate the molecule in addition to translating it.</p>

				<p>As the substituents about the alkene increase in complexity it is advantageous to simplify the groups using substitutive labels. For example, the relationship among the three alkene isomers shown is not immediately obvious. The alkyl branches have been inconveniently drawn in different conformations. This precludes a simple inspection of superposability. By replacing the alkyl substituents with their <b>abbreviated labels</b> [Provide a pop-up list; see below after Figure 7.1.7] the conformational permutations, while still occurring, no longer complicate the analysis and the relationships become apparent.</p>

				<p>There is a simpler analysis available. The other carbon of the alkene possesses identical groups. Imagine starting from the alkenyl carbon and progressing in a counterclockwise direction (green arrow); compare this with progressing in a clockwise direction (red arrow).
